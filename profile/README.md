Raindrop is committed to making the best free, open source, and premium Minecraft hack client for anyone and everyone to use. ‚ù§Ô∏è In fact, Raindrop has been doing this since **August 30th, 2022**. That's when Raindrop Client was created. If you'd like to use our client, go ahead! No one is stopping you. We'd love to be apart of the Minecraft hacking community and bring new client modules to the table.

### üë®‚Äçüíª The premium-for-free project

Raindrop Client is the premium-for-free project we are currently working on actively. With new modules to add to the client, it gets bigger and better with every update. If you'd like to help us contribute to this **amazing** client, you can do so by emailing us at contact.raindrop.team@gmail.com, or making a request in the [Discord]() server. Every single line of code counts, whether it be for evading anti-cheats, or for new modules.

If you'd like for us to add a module to the client, you can join the Discord server (link above) and make a request in #module-requests. On the flipside, if you want us to remove a module from the client, because it directly skids another client's module(s), you may contact us at the email provided above.

### üó£Ô∏è The Raindrop community

Raindrop Client also has a unique plugin system, where you can download Raindrop-compatible plugin(s), select the plugin(s) to launch with in the launcher, and boom! That plugin now has it's own module(s) in the Plugins category. You can find official/verified plugins in the Discord server (again, linked above), where in the #community-plugins channel, you can find a list of all the verified plugins that the Raindrop community has made.

If you'd like to make a plugin for yourself, you can find the plugin template [here](), which has all the files that will be necessary while in development of your plugin. If you're having trouble with something, or something errors, you can refer to the [Plugin Wiki]. The wiki has everything you need to know about the Raindrop Plugin API. Including, but not limited to, error handling, errors, block management, combat management, player management, and much more.

### üëÄ Raindrop's uniqueness

The Raindrop Client is very different from other clients. If you don't like how the modules are placed, you can rearrange them. If you don't like the Click GUI, and like the Nodus-type GUI, you may switch to that, too.

Don't like Raindrop's color scheme? You can change that? Don't like how the modules are sorted category-wise? You can change that! Did you're old client have barely and customization options for it's modules? Raindrop has 15+ customization options for each module! The list of customization options seems to never end.

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Buy us a coffee

We spend countless hours of our lives into updating Raindrop and it's subsequent repositories. It would mean the world to us if you donated to us on [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/raindrop_team). Every penny counts, and donating helps keep us motivated to work on the project.

Raindrop Client, made with ‚ù§Ô∏è, from the Raindrop Team.
